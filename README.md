 GenAI Workshop Experience – #genaiworkshop
Facilitator: Ajinkya Lohakare
Dates: 9th & 10th May 2025
I recently had the incredible opportunity to participate in a two-day Generative AI Workshop led by the brilliant Ajinkya Lohakare. The sessions were packed with knowledge, hands-on experience, and real-world applications of cutting-edge AI tools and techniques.
Throughout the workshop, we dived deep into the world of Generative AI and explored how it is revolutionizing content creation, automation, and intelligent systems. Here's a snapshot of the exciting projects we built from scratch:


🚀 Projects We Developed:


📝 Text-to-Text Generation – Automatically generate human-like text based on prompts.
🔊 Text-to-Audio Conversion – Transform written content into realistic speech.
🎥 Text-to-Video Creation – Generate simple videos based on input text using AI tools.
🤖 Q&A Chatbot using LLMs – Built an intelligent chatbot capable of answering questions with context.
🍽️ Recipe Generator Agent – An AI agent that creates unique recipes based on available ingredients.
🖼️ Image-based AI Agent – Designed an agent to work with and analyze images.

I’ve included the source code and generated outputs for all projects—each one showcasing the power and versatility of GenAI.

🧰 Tools & Requirements:
💻 Visual Studio Code (VS Code) – For writing and running the code.
🔑 Cohere API Key – For harnessing the power of natural language processing.
📦 Streamlit – A Python framework to build interactive AI web apps.
🧠 Phi – Used for creating advanced agents that can perform complex tasks.

This workshop was an eye-opening journey into the future of artificial intelligence. I’m excited to explore more in this domain and apply these skills to real-world challenges. A huge thanks to Ajinkya Lohakare for such an engaging and insightful experience! 🙌
